    <h2>Get Final Headcount</h2>
    <p>
        Work to confirm a solid headcount. Having this will help you when making food and swag orders. Generally, events see a 30-50% attrition rate, so make sure you consider this in your planning. Make a plan for what to do if you have more sign ups than your
        event is being planned for. If you exceed your initial goals you might need to make a waitlist. Try to give priority to hackers who are closer to your event since they are more likely to actually show up.

    <h2>Organize Transportation</h2>
    <p>
        If your venue is free, transportation and travel reimbursements are often the most expensive part of putting on a hackathon. After reviewing the information below, watch our short transportation webinar to ensure your transportation planning runs smoothly.
        While many hackers have come to expect some sort of funded transportation, it is not required in order to put on a successful hackathon.

    <h3>Charter Buses</h3>

    <p>
        Charter buses are typically the most affordable option for getting hackers to and from your event. Keep in mind as you plan that most buses fit 56 attendees, and the average cost per weekend is $3,300 (based on 31 hackathons in Spring 2014). Your hackathon
        date matters as well: for example, bus prices are often higher in April because so many schools charter them during that month for class trips.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Determine how many seats you’ll need</b>
        </li><br />
        <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
            <li>
                Reach out to student leadership at participating schools to find out how much interest there is in a bus. Have your contact create a Facebook event with the bus boarding time and ask them to invite as many people from the school that they want to.
            </li><br />
            <li>
                Some interested students won’t show up when it’s time to board; we recommend ordering one 56-seat bus per 70 "yeses"
            </li><br />
            <li>
                Dishing out seats on a first come, first serve often works best
            </li><br />
        </ul>
        <li>
            <b>Create a travel itinerary</b>
        </li><br />
        <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
            <li>
                Exact locations of pick-up and drop-off points
            </li><br />
            <li>
                Contact info for a point person at the destination and arrival locations
            </li><br />
            <li>
                Trip duration and distance
            </li><br />
        </ul>
        <li>
            <b>Collect quotes</b>

        <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
            <li>
                Use BusRates.com to sort bus companies by number of buses available, number of seats, bus ages, and cost. We recommend only requesting quotes from companies with 4 star ratings or above.

            <li>
                Sharethebus allows you to organize buses to your event in a central dashboard and request quotes directly from bus companies. They also will help you compare and find the cheapest bus company. The companies on Sharethebus are pre-vetted so you don't have
                to worry about ratings.

            <li>

        </ul>
    </ol>

    <h3>Travel Reimbursements</h3>

    <p>
        Occasionally, you will need to issue travel reimbursements for some or all of your attendees. A few tips:
    </p>

    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
        <li>
            Email attendees via a service like SendGrid or MailChimp with instructions about how to claim their reimbursements. Include a clear timeline with receipt due dates.
        </li><br />
        <li>
            Upload receipts (Wufoo is a good resource). All should clearly show price and date of purchase to qualify.
        </li><br />
        <li>
            Send reimbursements (Venmo is 25 cents per transaction)
        </li><br />
        <li>
            Keep all receipts for tax purposes
        </li><br />
    </ul>

    <div><br /></div>
    <h2>Order Supplies and Book Vendors</h2>
    <p>
        Ordering supplies and services a month before the event ensures you’ll have wiggle room to select the best prices and allow for shipping time.
    </p>

    <h3>T-shirts</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
        <li>
            $8 to $10 per head for American Apparel, or $4 to $6 for a cheaper brand
        </li><br />
    </ul>

    <h3>Food</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
        <li>
            24-hour event: 4 to 5 meals
        </li><br />
        <li>
            36-hour event: 6 meals
        </li><br />
        <li>
            To determine how much food you need, multiply $7 per meal x the number of meals x per head of expected attendance. Add $5 to $10 per person for snacks and drinks depending on length of your hackathon.
        </li><br />
        <li>
            Food is a great opportunity to showcase what makes your city special and celebrate any special themes you might have. Use it as an opportunity to share local cuisine that your participants are sure to remember.
        </li><br />
        <li>
            Develop a plan to Donate leftovers to homeless shelter
        </li><br />
    </ul>

    <h3>Tables and chairs</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
        <li>
            Assume 4-6 people per table depending on how large the tables are.
        </li><br />
        <li>
            Plan on having enough table and chairs for the maximum number of attendees you expect.
        </li><br />
    </ul>

    <h3>AV equipment</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
        <li>
            For opening ceremony and final demos, plan on having access to a room that can fit all of your attendees seated with a projector.

    <h2>Create Your Schedule</h2>
    <p>

<section>
    <a name="emergency-plan"></a>
    <div><br /></div>
    <h2>Finalize Your Emergency Plan</h2>
    <p>
        You should be hoping for the best but planning for the worst. Spend some time coming up with emergency/nightmare scenarios and build up a document with contingency plans. This document should also include emergency contact numbers and other vital information.
        Some examples of these scenarios include:
    </p>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
        <li>
            A fire starts in your venue.
        </li><br />
        <li>
            Too much power gets used and a fuse in the building gets tripped.
        </li><br />
        <li>
            A hacker has a medical emergency.
        </li><br />
        <li>
            Someone is caught trying to steal something expensive like networking equipment.
        </li><br />
    </ul>
    <p>
        The list goes on, and you should have instructions on how each one should be handled. Make sure all volunteers have access to the document, and having a physical copy of it on-site can be helpful.
    </p>
    <p>
        In terms of emergency contacts, you should include campus security, the local non-emergency police number (not 911) for situations that are not time-critical, and all of your main organizers, along with the times they will be available on-site.
    </p>
    <p>
        You should also notify local emergency services that you will be hosting a large event with a lot of students not from your school. They should have some protocol for large events and will ideally have a person on-site or on call through the duration
        of the event.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is impossible to prepare for every possible scenario, so if something unexpected happens, remember to stay calm, try to isolate the issue, and resolve it with a level head. <b>Make sure at least one member of your organizing team is awake and alert at all times.</b>
    </p>
