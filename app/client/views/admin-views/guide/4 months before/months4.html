    <h2>Build A Killer Leadership Team</h2>
    <p>
        Every first-rate hackathon has an exceptional leadership team behind it. When selecting yours, think like a startup CEO: choose enthusiastic and smart people with complementary skills. Here’s what a hackathon leadership team looks like:
    </p>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
        <li>
            Head of logistics — books venue, develops and runs schedule, orders services and supplies
        </li><br />
        <li>
            Head of finance — secures sponsorships, makes sure vendors get paid, and manages the cash flow and budget.
        </li><br />
        <li>
            Head of marketing — promotes event. In charge of marketing strategy, website, social media, etc.
        </li><br />
        <li>
            Head of hacker experience - this could be the responsibility of another member of the team, but it is extremely important to have everyone in your organization thinking about how to create the best possible hacker experience at your event.
        </li><br />
    </ul>

    <h2>Set Up A Placeholder Website</h2>

    <p>
        Until an event has a website, it doesn’t exist to most people. Publishing a basic website the second you’ve committed to hosting a hackathon will help you drive interest to it, capture potential attendee email addresses, and answer questions from interested
        students:
    </p>
    <p>
        The first iteration of your site should include:
    </p>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
        <li>
            Dates and venue (if you have them)
        </li><br />
        <li>
            A pre-registration form. (A few good options for this include SendGrid and LaunchRock.)
        </li><br />
        <li>
            A designated email address to answer potential attendees’ questions
        </li><br />
        <li>
            Links to your event’s Facebook page and Twitter account
        </li><br />
        <li>
            A date when visitors should check back for more info
        </li><br />
        <li>
            A basic FAQ about your event to explain things to someone who has never seen or been to a hackathon before
        </li><br />
        <li>
            A page just for sponsors, including:
        </li><br />
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
            <li>
                An email address for sponsorship inquiries
            </li><br />
            <li>
                Some information about your event and your team
            </li><br />
        </ul>

<h1>Sponsorship</h1>

<section>
    <h2>Introduction to Fundraising</h2>
    <p>
        It’s nearly impossible to host a serious hackathon without money. That said, landing quality sponsorship is manageable if you break the process into small steps and give yourself plenty of lead time. The more practice you get approaching and negotiating
        with potential backers, the better you’ll become at the art of fundraising.
    </p>
    <p>
        One thing to keep in mind as you work your way through this process: sponsors are like investors — they want to see you’re serious before they give you capital. In the same way you wouldn’t approach a VC without a product prototype, don’t reach out to
        sponsors until you’ve got evidence that your hackathon is well on its way to happening: a confirmed venue and time, pre-registrations from students, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you’re finished reading this section of the guide, we strongly recommend watching our fundraising webinar: Raising Sponsorship - A Workshop by MLH.

    <h2>Draft Your Budget</h2>
    <p>
        Before you can begin asking for money, get a sense of how much cash you need to pull off your hackathon. Create a budget template based on estimated costs and your expected number of attendees.
    </p>
    <iframe class="youtube" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ybgtN2GjTQ"></iframe>
    <p>
        Note: We recommend you build in a buffer of $1,000 to $3,000, depending on the size of the event. In our experience, organizers will always need this extra money.
    </p>

        Over the years the we've found the averages costs for major budget items are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
        <li>
            <b>Food</b>: $7 per person per meal
        </li><br />
        <li>
            <b>Snacks & Drinks</b>: $10 per person
        </li><br />
        <li>
            <b>T-Shirts</b>: $5-8 per person (dependent on volume)
        </li><br />
        <li>
            <b>Busses</b>: $3,500 per bus

    <h2>Understand Your Sponsors</h2>
    <h3>Who They Are, What They Want, And How They operate</h3>
    <p>
        You’ll be targeting five types of sponsors:
    </p>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
        <li>
            Financial — Cash for services. Most sponsors fall into this category.
        </li><br />
        <li>
            Presenting — Sponsors that co-host or co-brand your event. (Be careful not to give up too much control here.)
        </li><br />
        <li>
            Anchor brands — These companies make you legit in the eye of other sponsors.
        </li><br />
        <li>
            Strategic partners — Sponsors that help with marketing and promotion; often publications.
        </li><br />
        <li>
            In-kind — Donor companies. They can contribute hardware, t-shirts, etc.
        </li><br />
    </ul>
    <p>
        Sponsors support hackathons for three primary reasons:
    </p>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
        <li>
            To get real time feedback on their development products, especially APIs
        </li><br />
        <li>
            To raise awareness (or change the perception) of their brand
        </li><br />
        <li>
            To recruit interns and full-time employees, especially during the fall
        </li><br />
    </ul>
    <p>
        Sponsors’ top practical concerns:
    </p>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
        <li>
            Cost per attendee — sponsors want this to be low, while you want this to be as high as possible while keeping their support.
        </li><br />
        <li>
            Attendee value
        </li><br />
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
            <li>
                Are your hackathon’s attendees a good fit for the company in terms of recruiting, marketing, etc.?
            </li><br />
            <li>
                How hard is it for companies to reach this audience without your help?
            </li><br />
        </ul>
        <li>
            Who else is sponsoring?
        </li><br />
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
            <li>
                Depending on the sponsor, your other backers matter. Some companies prefer to sponsor events their competitors sponsor, whereas others want to ensure they’re the biggest name on your roster.
            </li><br />
        </ul>
        <li>
            Package Value
        </li><br />
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
            <li>
                Are they getting their money’s worth?
            </li><br />
        </ul>
        <li>
            The Force (a.k.a.) their gut
        </li><br />
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
            <li>
                How do the sponsors feel about your competency: is the event well-organized so far? Have you been professional in all communications?
            </li><br />
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2>Put Together A Sponsorship Prospectus</h2>

    <p>
        Before approaching sponsors, create a short info packet with three tiers of sponsorship. This doesn’t need to be fancy — just explain what a hackathon is and how they can prepare to get the most out of it. You should make it clear what you are providing,
        and mention a few things sponsors have done at other hackathons that you thought were awesome.
    </p>

    <p>
        Your prospectus should include:
    </p>

    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
        <li>
            The basics: date, location, number of expected attendees, etc.
        </li><br />
        <li>
            The story behind your event, an introduction to your team, and a note about what you’re trying to accomplish, as well as what makes your event special. What are its differentiating factors?
        </li><br />
        <li>
            An overview of available sponsorships — what companies get and how much it will cost them.
        </li><br />
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
            <li>
                We recommend including three sponsorship tiers: reasonable, moderate, and expensive. (Any one tier should not comprise more than 25 percent of your budget.)
            </li><br />
            <li>
                Let companies know custom packages are available.
            </li><br />
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Be sure to include the following info on all materials — we can’t tell you how many times this gets overlooked!
    </p>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
        <li>
            Event name
        </li><br />
        <li>
            Date
        </li><br />
        <li>
            Location
        </li><br />
        <li>
            Projected attendance
        </li><br />
        <li>
            Website URL
        </li><br />
        <li>
