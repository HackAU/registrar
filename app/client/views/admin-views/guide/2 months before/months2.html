    <h2>Line Up Great Prizes</h2>
    <p>
        Prizes are a great way to reward hackers for their hard work. When selecting them, it’s important to seriously consider why you are giving a prize, what sort of behaviors that prize rewards, and how you can go about motivating those behaviors. No one
        wants to be seen as a stingy starfish, but prizes say a lot about who you are as a community, why you are there in the first place, and they influence the vibe of your event — big time.

    <h2>Book Mentors And Judges</h2>

    <p>
        You’ll need to recruit a variety of tech experts to mentor your attendees, speak at your event and judge your hackathon. Consider targeting:
    </p>

    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
        <li>
            Experts from your school, including professors, deans, and alumni
        </li><br />
        <li>
            Local community leaders
        </li><br />
        <li>
            Reps from local tech companies
        </li><br />
        <li>
            Tech celebrities who have something to promote (best for bigger events)
        </li><br />
    </ul>
    <p>
        Networking tips for recruiting speakers and judges:
    </p>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
        <li>
            It’s similar to the process of contacting sponsors.
        </li><br />
        <li>
            Consider who you know and who your school knows
        </li><br />
        <li>
            Have department heads reach out for you when helpful
        </li><br />
    </ul>

    <h3>A Note About Judges</h3>

    <p>
        We recommend selecting judges that have a strong technical aptitude. If you’re planning to do Science Fair Judging and Presentations, your judges for each should be separate. For expo judging, ensure you have a minimum of one judge per thirty participants.

    <h2>Promote Your Event</h2>

    <p>
        When promoting your hackathon, it’s useful to keep in mind that most events have a 50 to 30 percent drop-off in attendance. Given these stats, it’s your goal to over-market and overbook!
    </p>

    <h3>Tell Your Hackathon’s Story</h3>

    <p>
        What’s your hackathon’s "brand?" How is it unique? Why would you want to attend?
    </p>

    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
        <li>
            The more tailored your message, the better. Make it school-specific.
        </li><br />
        <li>
            Use the same messaging to stay consistent and build momentum
        </li><br />
        <li>
            Highlight hackathon benefits perks and the ease of attending: it’s free of cost, transportation will be provided, etc.
        </li><br />
    </ul>

    <p>
        It would be great to include a short case study or example "about us" page from a successful hackathon here to show, rather than just tell, organizers how effective branding works.
    </p>

    <h3>Get The Word Out</h3>

    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
        <li>
            Invite students from other schools to attend
